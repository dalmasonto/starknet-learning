- As part of an inventory management system, design a generic struct called "Inventory" that can hold an array of items of any data type. Implement methods "addItem" and "removeItem" to add and remove items from the inventory. Demonstrate the usage of the "Inventory" struct with different types of items.

- Create a trait called "Combinable" that defines a method "combine" to merge two objects of the same type. Implement "Combinable" for the "WeatherData" struct from the previous questions, allowing you to combine weather data from two different sources (e.g., two weather stations).
